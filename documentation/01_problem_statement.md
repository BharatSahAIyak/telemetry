# Problem Statement: Why even need this telemetry service?
Traditional telemetry systems may focus on specific metrics or narrow aspects of system performance. Wide telemetry events aim to collect a broad range of data points, providing a more comprehensive view of system behavior.

By capturing a wide range of telemetry events, the system can provide more contextually rich insights into the performance and behavior of complex systems. This can help in understanding correlations, dependencies, and root causes of issues.

Wide telemetry events can be tailored to different use cases and requirements, providing greater flexibility and adaptability compared to traditional telemetry approaches. This allows organizations to capture the specific data points that are most relevant to their unique needs.

Another benefit is the Materialized view. These can store precomputed results of queries, which can significantly reduce the time and resources required to access and analyze telemetry data. This can be particularly advantageous in scenarios where real-time querying of raw telemetry data is not feasible due to performance constraints.
